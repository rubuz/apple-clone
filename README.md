## How it works



# Apple iPhone Clone
This project is a clone of the Apple iPhone website, created as a learning exercise to understand the basics of the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and Three.js libraries.

[Demo page](https://gregarious-manatee-6b4216.netlify.app/)

## Core stack: 
 
ReactJS + Tailwind + GSAP + Three.js

## Features

1. **Scrolling Animations:** The website uses the GSAP library to create smooth, visually appealing animations that are triggered by scrolling. This includes fading, scaling, and translating elements on the page. The animations are implemented in various components such as Features, Model, and HowItWorks using the animateWithGsap and animateWithGsapTimeline functions.

2. **Video Carousel:** The website features a video carousel that allows users to view different videos by scrolling. This is achieved using the GSAP library for the animations and React for managing the state of the carousel.

3. **3D Model of iPhone:** The website includes a 3D model of the iPhone, created using the Three.js library. The model can be viewed from different angles and is part of the Model component.
